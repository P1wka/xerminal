# xerminal

## How to download?
- Firstly, open CMD and paste the following code: "git clone https://github.com/P1wka/xerminal/",
- Or you can download it manually.
- Then, find location and run it. (A compiled .exe file is included in the project, you do not have to download Visual Studio.)

## Warnings!
- Commands like "color", "wsl" or "cd" are not added yet!
- If you use the "wsl" command, it will transfer you to the main CMD.
- It's still under the development.
